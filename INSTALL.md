The following commands should install any necessary prerequisites

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-tk qt5-default

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Additionally, you will need an arduino compiler/IDE to compile and upload the Arduino code. I personally use the standard Arduino IDE, but your setup may vary.
It can be installed using the following command:

sudo apt-get install arduino

If on windows, install python3.4+, which should include pip and tk by default, and QT5.7+. Get the Arduino installer from their website.
